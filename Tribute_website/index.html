                    <P><b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b>, known as the "Missile Man of India," was an 
                        eminent scientist, visionary, and the 11th President of India, serving 
                        from 2002 to 2007. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he came from a humble background but rose to prominence through hard work and dedication. His contributions to India’s space and defense programs, particularly through his work on the development of ballistic missiles and launch vehicles, earned him a place among the nation’s most celebrated scientists. As a leader, he was known for his humility, simplicity, and deep connection with the youth. He passionately advocated for education, innovation, and self-reliance, inspiring countless young Indians to dream big and work toward a better future. Even after his presidency, Dr. Kalam continued to engage with students and share his vision for India's development. His book Wings of Fire, an autobiography, remains a source of inspiration to many. Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture, leaving behind a legacy of dedication, resilience, and hope for generations to come.</P>
